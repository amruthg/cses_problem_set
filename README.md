Hello All,

  I will be adding all the important points that I have learnt in my cses journey in this place. 

  >we avoid using o(n^2) computations as, for n=2*10^5 it becomes 4*10^10 which is very large compared to the number of computations allowed(10^7 to 10^8).

  ###DP###
  >the way to solve dp problems is to use first take your base cases and either build from top to bottom or the reverse.

  >In case your dp doesnt work, make sure your varable sizes are in long long.
